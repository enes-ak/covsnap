abstract: >-
  covsnap computes per-target and per-exon depth metrics from
  BAM/CRAM files aligned to hg38, producing machine-readable metrics
  and human-readable interpreted reports with PASS/FAIL coverage
  classifications. It ships with a bundled GENCODE v44 gene index
  and requires no internet access or GTF files at runtime.
